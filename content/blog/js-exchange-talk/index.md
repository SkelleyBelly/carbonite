### Introduction
On 28/01/21 I spoke on the [JavaScript Exchange](https://www.linkedin.com/company/javascript-exchange/) - "A Community Meetup dedicated to bringing together JavaScript Developers to discuss all things JS"

In the following blog I'm going to quickly tell you about the reasons why you might want to do something similar for your client or yourself. I will also include information on how I went about it and the prequisute steps to ensure you have the support from both AND as well as you client.

### The Why
There are various reasons why it is a good idea to talk at events like this. These mainly fall into the following 3 categories..

## Benefits for AND:
We have some of the leading minds in software development here at AND, but we are very "internal". We have such an active and extensive internal community that we often choose to have our Techy Discussions just between ourselves. This is great for upskilling ANDis but means that we are very quiet on external forums, blogs and meetups.. Nobody knows about us. We can change that by speaking at these events.

Speaking at these events and growing the company's "eminence" has many obvious benefits including more and better choice of clients, acquisition of talent and more recongition for the amazing work that we do. 

## Benefits for the Client:
This is a really key one in terms of being able to speak at one of these events about client work. You need to be able convince the client that allowing you to talk about their project in an external forum is a good idea.

One of the main drivers in my talk was Developer Hiring. At AND we are often building in house dev capability at the same time as building a solution. One of the best ways to attract talent is to show off the new and amazing technology we are developing or the amazing developer experience we are creating in the Client's organisation.

But there are othe reasons too! Any publicity is good publicity right? A client might be happy that you are showcasing the digital transformation they are going through, or the planned/delivered improvements to their service/web site.

## Benefits to you!
On top of all of this going the extra mile to do this work could have some real benefits to your own career and personal development. I personally learned a lot from this experience. I'm not going to lie it wasn't easy and some late nights were spent perfecting my slides however, I know that next time I am speaking in a public forum, voluntarily or as part of my job, things will be a lot easier

### How
So how did I do it? Here I will outline some things you MUST/SHOULD/COULD do before speaking at an event like this:

1. MUST Get sign off from AND this includes both Service Delivery Team and AND Events Coordinator (Mel) in Tenzing
1. MUST Get buy in from the Client, ask Service Delivery for help/advice for how to obtain this
1. Create draft slides - not too much detail, they will change a lot!
1. Dry run/playback with Service Delivery Team and AND Events Coordinator (iterate/absorb changes)
1. Dry run/playback with client, make sure you frame it in a way where you are asking for their input
1. Dry run with audience type. My audience was developers so before finalising the content I played back to some friendly faces in AND to make sure the content was relevant
1. Refine/Design/Iterate through all of the steps above
1. All parties are happy with the slide content its time to inject some style branding. Ask for AND Events Coordinator for advice on ensuring your slides are ready for the big stage
1. Breath, smile and perform! :) 

### Lessons Learnt
On the whole I was happy with how it went. I was very happy until I watched the full recording haha but you are your worst critic so some of the things I would try to improve for next time

1. The power of the pause, when I was doing my talk I thought I was going really slowly, on reflection maybe not enough. Remember, you know your content really well, for those watching its the first time they are seeing it. Technical topics are not that easy to grasp in a matter of seconds
1. Silence is golden.. We all do it.. Urrrmmm, Urghhh, yes like.. All the ways our brain tries to fill empty gaps while talking with irrelevant sound. This actually makes you much harder to understand as it interrupts the audience's thinking
1. Plant a question. We've all been there.. Are there any questions? `tumbleweed(20s)`. Best to pre-empt that by planting an ANDi in the audience with a question just in case
