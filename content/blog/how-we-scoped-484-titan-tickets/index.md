### Introduction
At Titan Travel we had a big scope for our discovery and PoC phase. We were asked to create a roadplan, with time estimates, for a fully greenfield website rebuild. This equated to 484 tickets which we had to prioritise, technically validate and create estimates for.

In this 2min read I am going to walk you through how we did this. I hope this will help others who find themselves in similar positions in the future.

### How we did it (recipe style)

1. Captured requirements in Trello
We found Trello the easiest and quickest tool for us to capture requirements in. It's flexible and simple to use and easy to gain access to, which is not always easy at the start of a project

1. MOSCOW Prioritisation on all tickets
As we created these tickets we added a "MOCOW" value to define prioritisation. MOSCOW stands for "MUST, SHOULD, COULD, WILL NOT". In our case, MUSTs were for priorities out of user testing as well as features that were existing on the current website. If it was not already on the website it was automatically a "SHOULD"

1. T-shirt sizing - XS, S, M, L, XL
Not all stories had requirements granular enough to be able to measure complexity and therefore story points. Also story points should only be calculated once the full developer team is in place. Therefore, for now, the best we could do was a 'finger in the air' size estimate.

1. Best and Worst case time estimates for t-shirt sizes
In order to carry out some high level roadmapping and planning, we had to get some idea of the time it takes to develop these tickets. We did this with the following table where each t-shirt size had a best and worst case scenario time estimate:

| Size | Best Case (days) | Worst Case (days) |
|:----:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
